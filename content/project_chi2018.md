# Biography
I received my PhD in Computer Science in Fall 2017. I am advised by [Professor Feng Liu](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fliu/) in the [Computer Graphics & Vision Lab](http://graphics.cs.pdx.edu/) at Portland State University.

My research is in Human-Computer Interaction. My PhD's research theme explores novel visualization and interaction techniques for video. Most recently, I've been exploring Virtual Reality interfaces to support media production. My research has received **Best Paper Honorable Mention** awards at ACM CHI 2013, 2015, and 2017.

Starting November 2017, I'm a research scientist at [Adobe's Creative Intelligence Lab](https://research.adobe.com/), San Francisco, California.

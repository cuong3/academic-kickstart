# Biography
I'm a research scientist at [Adobe's Creative Intelligence Lab](https://research.adobe.com/), San Francisco, California.

I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2017. I am advised by [Professor Feng Liu](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fliu/) in the [Computer Graphics & Vision Lab](http://graphics.cs.pdx.edu/) at Portland State University. 

My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and VR/AR. I'm interested in building new interfaces for content creation in virtual and augmented reality, viewing and editing video, new forms of learning, and collaboration technologies. My research has received **Best Paper Honorable Mention** awards at ACM CHI 2013, 2015, and 2017. Some of these work were demoed live at Adobe MAX Sneaks 2017 ([#CloverVR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFkJXwH1VTE)) and 2019 ([#ProjectPronto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QsvjrbKeI4)). 

My PhD's dissertation explores [360 degree video authoring tools in VR](https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/4037/). I helped [ship some parts of this work into Adobe Premiere and After Effects](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/immersive-video.html).
